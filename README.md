# Abstract
Facial recognition technology is widely used across various industries for its convenience and efficiency, yet it faces significant security challenges such as spoofing attacks, privacy concerns, and data breaches. This paper explores the industry's current trends and needs for robust security measures, focusing on critical applications like mobile device authentication, law enforcement, and access control systems. It reviews existing security solutions, including liveness detection, multimodal biometric systems, encryption techniques, and AI-driven improvements, analyzing their benefits and limitations. To address these challenges, a new solution is proposed that integrates advanced liveness detection using 3D depth-sensing cameras with AI-based behavioral analysis, aiming to enhance system security and accuracy. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of continuous research and development to ensure facial recognition technology remains effective and secure across various applications.
